The main cost lies in sourcing quality B2B data, which can easily exceed thousands of dollars.  

If you examine **Apollo's pricing**:
- $49 for a thousand emails  
- $149 for four thousand emails

   - Recommended Filters:  
     - **"Likely to Engage"** under "Email Status"  
     - **"Verified"** under "Email Status"  

   These filters ensure high-quality emails, minimizing invalid or risky ones that could harm your outreach campaign's deliverability.
